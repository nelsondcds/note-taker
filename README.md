# note-taker by Nelson Carlos Da Silva

This repository contains my submission for the Express.js Challenge: Note Taker. The challenge consists of creating an application called Note Taker that is used to write, save, and delete notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save, delete, and retrieve note data from a JSON file.
